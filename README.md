# Example of testing Salesforce Functions with CircleCI

Utilize CircleCI & GitHub to enable CI/CD with Salesforce Functions.


## Requirements

- a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- a [CircleCI account](https://circleci.com/signup/) authenticated with the above GitHub account
- a Salesforce **Dev Hub** that `sfdx` will use for [scratch orgs](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sfdx_app_dev/sfdx_app_dev_setup_dx#sfdx_app_dev_setup_dx_scratch_org_def)
  * [Sign-up for a Developer org](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup)
  * [Enable Dev Hub](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.218.0.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_enable_devhub.htm)
- an [sfdx project](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_create_new.htm)
  * created with `sfdx force:project:create`
  * containing at least one Evergreen Function
    * with working tests via `npm test` (the default function includes a real unit test)
    * created with `sfdx evergreen:function:create` ([example default function](functions/ExampleFunction/))
  * pushed to a repo within the above GitHub account


## Setup

üíª *These instructions require a command shell such as **`bash` or `zsh` on Linux or macOS**, and may not be compatible with other operating systems.*

1. [create a certificate](#1-create-a-certificate) (public/private key pair) for CircleCI auth with Salesforce Dev Hub
1. [create a "CircleCI" Connected App](#2-create-a-circleci-connected-app) in your Salesforce DevHub
1. [add CircleCI config](#3-add-circleci-config) to your project
1. [create the CircleCI project](#4-create-circleci-project) for the GitHub repo
1. [start building](#5-start-building) üèó


### 1. Create a certificate

The certificate will be used for cryptographic verification of authentication requests from `sfdx` on CircleCI. When prompted, set the certificate's common name to ‚ÄúCircleCI‚Äù. Other fields will be visible in the Salesforce Connected App's details, but can be safely ignored.

In your command shell:

```bash
mkdir circleci-jwt-auth/ && cd circleci-jwt-auth/

export PASS="$(openssl rand -hex 20)"
openssl genrsa -aes256 \
  -passout "pass:$PASS" \
  -out connected-app.pass.key \
  4096
openssl rsa -passin "pass:$PASS" \
  -in connected-app.pass.key \
  -out connected-app.key
rm connected-app.pass.key

# This next command will create the certificate identity;
# fill in sensible values, which will appear in the connected app in Salesforce;
# set the Common Name to "CircleCI".
openssl req -new \
  -key connected-app.key \
  -out connected-app.csr

openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 \
  -in connected-app.csr \
  -signkey connected-app.key \
  -out connected-app.crt
base64 connected-app.key > connected-app.key.base64
```

ü§ê  The resulting `.key` & `.key.base64` files contain secret data. Maybe you should **save them to a secure note, such as in LastPass**, but **do not commit them to version control**.


### 2. Create a "CircleCI" Connected App

Create a Connected App in the Salesforce Dev Hub that provides authentication for external services based on the new certificate.

In Salesforce **Setup** ‚Üí **App Manager**, create a **New Connected App**, with the following set:

- **Name** `CircleCI`
- **Contact Email**
  - your own org's admin email
- **Enable OAuth Settings** check ‚úÖ
- **Callback URL** `https://localhost:1717/OauthRedirect`
  - allows local `sfdx` CLI to complete auth flow
- **User Digital Signatures** check ‚úÖ
  - select the file (created above) `circleci-jwt-auth/connected-app.crt`.
- **Selected Oauth Scopes** required by `sfdx` CLI:
  - "Manage user data via APIs (api)"
  - "Manage user data via Web browsers (web)"
  - "Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)"
- **Save** the new app
  - üìù  Note the **Consumer Key** value of the Connected App for use later in CircleCI's `SFDX_CONSUMER_KEY` environment variable.

Then, **Manage** the app:

- **Edit Policies** ‚Üí **Permitted Users** select:
  - "Admin approved users are pre-authorized"
- **Save** the app 

Then, **Manage Profiles**:
 
- select: "System Administrator"
- **Save** the profile assignment

### 3. Add CircleCI config

Copy [`.circleci/config.yml`](.circleci/config.yml) from this repo into your project, commit, & push to GitHub.


### 4. Create CircleCI project

Visit your [CircleCI **Projects**](https://app.circleci.com/projects/) dashboard to enable this project.

When enabling it, choose use your own existing `config.yml` and start building immediately. The first build will fail, because we need to setup the Connected App certificate/JWT auth ‚ùå

Configure the CircleCI project to edit its **Environment Variables**. Set the following JWT auth environment variables:

  - **`SFDX_CONSUMER_KEY`** to the Consumer Key display in Salesforce Setup for the Connected App
  - **`SFDX_JWT_KEY`** to the contents of `circleci-jwt-auth/connected-app.key.base64`
    - clipboard copy on macOS: `cat circleci-jwt-auth/connected-app.key.base64 | pbcopy`
  - **`SFDX_USERNAME`** the Salesforce username of a **System Administrator** (or whatever Profile you assigned to the Connected App).


### 5. Start Building

To start building, either click re-run in CircleCI web UI, or push new commits to the GitHub repo.

Now, assuming your tests work, the CircleCI job should be successful ‚úÖ
